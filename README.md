# FortuneWeb
A fortune teller web-app utilizing tarot cards as a medium. 

### Features:
- **Draw** tarot cards from a virtual deck
  - Cards are initially flipped when drawn to maximize dramatic appeal
- **Drag and drop** cards anywhere on the playmat, allowing users to design custom spread layouts
  - Drawn cards can be replaced by simply clicking *Replace Tarot*. this will regenerate all cards' data, while keeping their positions on the playmat
- Playmat saves card data locally and persistantly (i.e. cards and their positions are saved between sessions)
- Activate *Grid Mode* to render cards in a mobile-friendly, flowing grid.
  - Using *Grid Mode* won't erase positions of cards, so spreads persist regardless of easier viewing
- Search through the *library* of cards with easy filtering and a searchbar for easy card-meaning research.
